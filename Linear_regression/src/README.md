### Conclusion
- `Q = 1/N sum(|e|)` 
  - Pros: Doing quite well with abnormal data 
  - Cons: Can be minimized using numerical methods only
- `Q = 1/N sum(e^2)` 
  - Pros: Minimalized using analytical method (by calculating derivative) 
  - Cons: Very sensitive to abnormal data
### Run

python3 linear_regression.py
